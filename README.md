Our project was to create a playlist using the data structure linked list.
The playlist basically allows one to add and delete tracks from the playlist .
It allows one to play song forward and backwords hence the reason why a linked list was used.
One can search for a specific song they would like to view.
The code is for a music play algorithm of a mobile application. The algorithm used the data structure linked list, to enable the users the function of playing tracks in both directions the concept of the double linked list was introduced. The algorithm allows the users to repeat the playlist by applying the concept of a circular linked list, meaning the playlist will play back to back until user input dictates otherwise. The algorithm allows the user to edit the playlist by removing(old) and adding(new) track to the playlist at will. The algorithm has a search that give the app the functionality to search for a specific track from the playlist. The algorithm was written in the programming language java.
